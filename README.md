# Udacity Project: 

# Travel  App

# Project Five - Travel App (Front End Developer Udacity Nanodegree)
# What I used: pug, SCSS, Javascript , webpack

# Project Objective
To build a travel application that contains a simple form which obtains information on user's upcoming trip - destination and departure date. With the help of external APIs - Geonames, Dark Sky and Pixabay, the app then displays weather and an image of the location on that given date. This is project #5 - part of my Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree.


## Run project

## install file
  ` $ npm install `
Below shows how to run in development and production mode.
### run in development mode
To start the webpack dev server at port 8800

` $ npm run build-dev`

### run in production mode
Generate the dist files and then start server at port 5500

` $ npm run build-prod`

` $ npm run start`
Here, we have two webpack config files for both development mode(`webpack.config.dev.js`) and production mode(`webpack.config.prod.js` )

We also have a `package.json` to manage dependencies

# Testing

Testing is done with Jest. To run test, use the command 

`npm run test`.
